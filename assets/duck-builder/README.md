# Duck Builder!
This directory contains everything you need to build a procedural ducky!

## Silverduck templates
In the `silverduck_templates` folder, you'll find the duck components rendered in a silvery gradient. These will be the templates we will paint with random colors to create ducks of random colors. We will simple overlay a transparent color block of the same size in order to make it look like it's purple or pink or whatever we want.

These assets are exactly the same size, so you simply put them all in the same space and respect transparency.

**The layer order must follow the numbers in the filenames** - 1 must be on top, and 5 at the very bottom.

## Ducky masks
In the `masks` folder, you'll find a corresponding mask for every duck component. This can be used together with your transparent color film to shape it so it will perfectly fit on top of the silverduck templates. This might not be necessary, no idea. Just delete them if we can solve it without these.

## Accessories
In the `accessories` folder, you'll find hats, equipment and outfits. These can be overlaid over the duck itself, and have already been positioned and masked to fit perfectly.

Some of the accessories will overlap one another, so you won't be able to use multiple accessories of _any type_, but it's usually safe to combine one of each type. For example, one hat and one equipment is always safe. One equipment and one outfit is usually safe. Outfits and hats may clash. Multiple of the same type will never work.
