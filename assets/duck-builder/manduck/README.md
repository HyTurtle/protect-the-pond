# Procedural manduck assets
Here's everything you need to render a procedural, random manduck.

There are two variations. These variations have completely different outfits, clothes and equipment, but **they share the same head and hats**.

### Render order, bottom to top:
- manduck_bill
- manduck_head
- manduck_eye
- manduck clothes, like shirt, pants and dress
- manduck outfits (NOT BEARD)
- manduck equipment, like weapons and wands
- manduck hands and arms
- manduck beard (must be rendered on top of everything.)
- manduck hat


**_NEVER RENDER NINJA TOGETHER WITH OTHER ACCESSORIES!_**
